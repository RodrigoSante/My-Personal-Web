I received my professional training at UTN (National Technological University) in the field of civil engineering, but over the years, I discovered that my true calling was in programming. This website is one of the first ones I created to share my work publicly. In the future, I plan to continue working on projects to apply my knowledge, which will be available here. Without further ado, I wanted to thank you for taking the time to explore my work.",
