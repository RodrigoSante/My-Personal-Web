I professionally trained at the UTN (National Technological University) in the civil engineering career, and over the years, I discovered that my true calling was in programming. This website is one of the first ones I've created to share my work publicly, and in the future, I plan to continue working on projects to apply my knowledge, which will be available here. Without further ado, I wanted to thank you for taking the time to get to know my work.",
